    "class = (A0 and A1) or (B0 and B1)\n",

    "The goal is to show whether ICECREAM is able to find the minimal coalitions of features which explain the target value. By definition of the dataset, these minimal explanations should never include any of the two features `Irrelevant` and `Correlated`. "
